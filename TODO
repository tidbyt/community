TODO(mark):
- Add issue and PR templates: https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests
- Add details either as config or as part of the starlark
- Make fuzzy clock a model citizen that includes good code structure and unit tests
- Add codegen so we can `make applet` and it will plop out a new applet.
