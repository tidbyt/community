# Modifying Apps
Have a feature you want in an existing app? Want to change the way an existing app works? This guide is for you! There're two things you should know:
- We believe that code speaks
    - This means we will prioritize a pull request over a feature request.
- Original contributors own the product direction
    - The original contributor's name is on the app, so we'll want their feedback before we merge the change.

So what does this all mean? If you want to modify or extend an existing app, make a pull request! We'll ask the original author to take a look and get their feedback before we merge it.
