# Weatherbard

Weatherbard combines real-time weather data with poetic reflections drawn from a Mary Oliver–inspired tone. It turns your Tidbyt screen into a tranquil window onto the sky, inviting stillness and presence with each new update.

## 🌤 What It Does

- Fetches current weather for your location from OpenWeatherMap
- Displays the temperature
- Scrolls a poetic line or two that matches the weather mood

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can personalize Weatherbard in the Tidbyt app:

- **Location**: Enter your city and country (e.g. `London,UK`, `Seattle,US`)
- **Units**: Choose between Fahrenheit (`imperial`) and Celsius (`metric`)

## 📖 Poetry Source

All poetic lines are original compositions, written in the style of Mary Oliver and tailored to conditions like:

- Clear
- Clouds
- Rain
- Snow
- Mist
- Fog
- Drizzle
- Thunderstorm
- Haze

Each condition has 10–30 lines that rotate on each update.
