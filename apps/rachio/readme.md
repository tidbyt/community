# Rachio Applet for Tidbyt

Displays your Rachio events. 

Pick your device and your preferences and it will display the last and/or previous watering scheduled item.

You can hide it when it has nothing to display (like in the middle of winter). 

If you have multiple Rachio Devices on your account, consider installing the Rachio App for each device.
