## Setup

### 1. Get Your Free API Key

2. Create a free account
3. Generate an API key
4. Copy the API key for use in step 3

### 2. Find Your Stop Codes

Muni stop codes are 4-5 digit numbers found on bus stop signs and station platforms:

- Look for small numbers on the bus stop sign
- Or use the [511.org Trip Planner](https://511.org/transit) to find stop codes
- Example stop codes: `16995` (Market & Castro), `13128` (Powell Station)

### 3. Configure the App

1. Install the Muni Departures app on your Tidbyt
2. Enter your 511.org API key
3. For each line:
   - Select the transit line (F, J, 38, etc.)
   - Enter the stop code
4. Save your configuration

ðŸŸ¡ J   CHURCH / 24TH ST

```

## Troubleshooting

### "API Key Required" Message
- Double-check your API key is entered correctly
- Ensure your 511.org account is active

### "No Data" Message
- Verify the stop code is correct
- Check if the selected line serves that stop
- Some stops may have limited weekend/evening service

### Long Stop Names
- Stop names automatically scroll if they're too long
- Ampersands (&) are displayed as slashes (/) for better readability

## Privacy & Rate Limits

- Your API key stays private and is only used by your Tidbyt
- Each user gets their own 511.org rate limits
- The app caches stop names for 5 minutes to reduce API calls
- Real-time data refreshes every 30 seconds
