# Verge Taglines

This app makes a request to the main page of popular tech news site, [The Verge](https://theverge.com), in order to display the latest tagline at the top of the page.

- No configuration is required.
- Requests are cached for 15min.
- Taglines 13 characters are shorter are centered while longer ones are scrolled using a marquee.

This app is inspired by the [Twitter bot](https://github.com/TylerCarberry/VergeTaglines) with the same purpose.
