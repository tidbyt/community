# Fly.io for Tidbyt

Displays the current status of the machines running on your [Fly.io Apps](https://fly.io/)

## Set up

1. Create a Fly.io API Key with: `fly tokens create readonly`
2. Include everything in the key, including the `FlyV1` at the beginning
3. Enter the name of your app, found on your Fly.io Dashboard

## Usage

This app will try to display all of the machines for the App you configure and a status indicator for them.

The machine names will be animated from right to left if there is overflow.

Right now all statuses [defined by Fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/machines/machine-states/) are supported:
