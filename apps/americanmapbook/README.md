# American Mapbook

## Overview

American Mapbook is your personal journey tracker across the United States. Whether you're chasing history, nature, or culture, this interactive app lets you map your visits to State Capitols, State Parks, and UNESCO World Heritage Sites with ease and clarity.

Each location appears on a vibrant, customizable map—yellow for visited, grey for unvisited by default, or use your own color scheme to suit your style. As you explore, the app gives you the option to maintain a running tally of sites you've checked off, helping you visualize your progress across the country.

It’s more than just a map—it’s your growing story of adventure, discovery, and connection with America’s landmarks.
