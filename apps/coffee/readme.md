# Coffee for Tidbyt

Created by: Robert Ison

Displays either a random coffee image, or a random coffee order, with a detailed explanation of what is in it.
When you choose to display a random coffee order, you can check which recipes can be selected. If you want to only every display "Cappuccino" for example, only pick that from the list.

Disply suggestion, schedule this app to display each day when you typically decide what coffee to make. Use the selections to filter only coffee preparations you like, then let this app decide what you'll drink each day. 

If you are displaying this in a cafe, display all day but only display the orders you can manage.

Goditi il tuo caff√®!
