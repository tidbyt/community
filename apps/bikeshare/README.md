# Bikeshare Applet for Tidbyt

Displays the availability of bikes and parking respectively for a user selected bikeshare provider and stops.
The applet fetches the availability status for a given provider and caches them for one minute.
Available providers are gathered from [North American Bike Share Association's bikeshare list](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv) on GitHub and cached for 24 hours.
