# Fly The L

Borne out of a desire to be notified every time the Cubs lose, here is the app Fly The L!

On the rare occasions the Cubs win, you would see this:

When the Cubs lose you would see this:

But it also works for any team, such as the Orioles:

You can see a preview of an upcoming game, you control the hour of the day it switches from showing you a previous result to the next game:

When a game is in progress, get LIVE updates!
