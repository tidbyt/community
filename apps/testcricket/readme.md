Similar to my other cricket apps, but this one is for test matches 

Select your team and it will show if they have an upcoming match, current live scores or recent result

Live scores will show team scores & batsman scores, then scroll through the day & session, how much they lead or trail, overs left in the day, partnership and current bowler's figures

Example
