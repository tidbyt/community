Applet: PGA Tour
Summary: Shows PGA Leaderboard
Description: This app displays the leaderboard for the current PGA Tour event, taken from ESPN data feed. The leaderboard will show the first 24 players. Players currently on course are shown in different shades of yellow - going from dark yellow for those players just starting to white for those who have completed their rounds. Players who have not started are shown in green.

Note - can easily make LPGA, European Tour or Korn Ferry versions if there is enough interest.

Big shoutout to LunchBox8484 for the NHL Standings app where this is heavily borrowed/stolen from
