Applet: PGA Tour
Summary: Shows PGA Leaderboard
Description: This app displays the leaderboard for the current PGA Tour event. You can show the opposite field event if there is one. 
Author: M0ntyP

Big shoutout to LunchBox8484 for the NHL Standings app where this is heavily borrowed/stolen from

v1.1 
Added rotation speed options and slight formatting change to tournament title (removed "The")

v1.2 
Added ability to show opposite field events, for the 4 times a year this happens

v1.2b 
Bug fix - when there are multiple events on (opposite field events) the app is showing both leaderboards under the 1 tournament heading
This has been fixed

v2.0 - Major update
Added ability to show how many holes the player has completed or tee time if not started. Shade of yellow font color function still in place as well
Added different colors for title bar during majors
Formatting changes
Code re-arrange & clean up and hopefully more efficient!

v2.1
Fix - Colors for majors not working, fixed!

v2.1a
Updated caching function

v2.2
Added better playoff handling

v2.3 
Give user a choice of single color for the in progress rounds or use the color gradient option. Single color is the default
Now showing scores for completed rounds rather than "F" 
Removed tournament name formatting from both player/score related functions - should add efficiency?
Added function to revise some tournament names to make them more readable and/or fit the width of the Tidbyt better

v2.3.1
Fixed bug regarding opposite field events

v2.4
Changed tee times feature to only display them when the leader's time is less than 12hrs away, and then show everyone's tee time. Previously it was showing a mix of round scores and tee times, which didnt look right

v2.5
Updated Tournament IDs for 2024 Season

v2.6
Added handling for players with non-standard characters in their surname and also distinguish between players with same surname
Using dictionary list for shortened Tournament Names
Using dictionary list for colors in Majors (and The Players tournament)

v2.6.1
Updated PLAYER_MAPPING 

v2.6.2
Updated PLAYER_MAPPING
Allowed extra char in Tournament Name

v2.6.3
Updated Player Name Mapping logic to stop partial ID matches
