Applet: PGA Tour
Summary: Shows PGA Leaderboard
Description: This app displays the leaderboard for the current PGA Tour event. You can show the opposite field event if there is one. 
Author: M0ntyP

Big shoutout to LunchBox8484 for the NHL Standings app where this is heavily borrowed/stolen from

v1.1 
Added rotation speed options and slight formatting change to tournament title (removed "The")

v1.2 
Added ability to show opposite field events, for the 4 times a year this happens

v1.2b 
Bug fix - when there are multiple events on (opposite field events) the app is showing both leaderboards under the 1 tournament heading
This has been fixed

v2.0 - Major update
Added ability to show how many holes the player has completed or tee time if not started. Shade of yellow font color function still in place as well
Added different colors for title bar during majors
Formatting changes
Code re-arrange & clean up and hopefully more efficient!

v2.1
Fix - Colors for majors not working, fixed!

v2.1a
Updated caching function

v2.2
Added better playoff handling

v2.3 
IDEA - better tournament naming especially for elevated events?
