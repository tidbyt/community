## Authentication

Weight Gurus does not provide an open API to get access to your data, so this app uses your Weight Gurus email address and password, just like the official mobile app does.

## Notes

Based on the [FitBit applet](https://github.com/tidbyt/community/tree/main/apps/fitbitweight)
Uses reverse-engineered auth code from [MarkWalters-pw](https://gist.github.com/MarkWalters-pw/08ea0e8737e3e4d11f70427ef8fdc7df) and [merval](https://github.com/merval/weightgurus)
