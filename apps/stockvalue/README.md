# Stock Value Price Applet for Tidbyt

Allows you to track the value of a stock that you currently own. I use this to always remind me of my RSU value while working to motivate me. You will need to enter in the company stock symbol, number of shares you have, and your alphavantage API key. If you need to get a API KEY, it's free at https://www.alphavantage.co/
