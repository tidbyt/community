# Stock Spotlight
Stock Spotlight is a [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com) applet that allows you to add up to 3 of your favorite stocks. This applet uses [Finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io) for the latest stock data. You will need to use your own Finnhub API key for Stock Spotlight to workâ€”[get one here](https://finnhub.io).

Stock prices will refresh every 60 seconds. If you're adding more than one instance of this applet, you'll need to be mindful of Finnhub API limits.

### Configure Applet
1. Input your Finnhub API key under `Finnhub.io API Key`.
2. Enter up to 3 stock symbols you'd like to track.
