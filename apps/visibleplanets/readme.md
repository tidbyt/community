# VisiblePlanets for Tidbyt

Pick a planet, and this app will display information where in the sky it is based on your location.

For inner planets (mercury, venus), you can see these just before and after sunrise and sunset at times. Outer planets you'll really need to wait until it is dark. The application will provide guidance, like telling you the planet will easier to see after sunset in those cases.

You can have the app skip displaying information for planets that are below your horizon by selecting "Hide when the selected planet is not visible".

If you want to track more than one planet, I'd suggest installing this app once per planet, have it skip when not visible because it is below the horizon. I would also suggest to set the hours to only run from dusk to dawn to save a few API calls to Astronomyapi.com who have graciously set up this feed for developers to program such apps.
