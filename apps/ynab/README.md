Welcome to the YNAB Tidbyt App!

This app uses the YNAB API (https://api.youneedabudget.com/v1#/) to display your categories in your last used budget that are negative or partially spent for the current month.

You will need to supply an access token associated with your YNAB account in order to enable the Tidbyt app's connection to YNAB. The directions for retrieving the token are here (https://api.youneedabudget.com/).

Possible Enhancements:

* Display different colors if running total is overspent within the month
* "Pin" categories to always display, regardless of current balance
* Display uncategorized transactions
