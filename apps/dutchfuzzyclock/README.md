# Dutch Fuzzy Clock

Displays the time of the day in human readable form in the Dutch way. Heavily inspired by the original Fuzzy Clock. The App is in Dutch and English.

The Dutch way is pretty weird. Take these examples:
| Time | The Dutch way |
| --- | --- |
| 10:10 | Ten past ten |
| 10:20 | Ten till half eleven |
| 10:30 | Half eleven |
| 10:40 | Ten past half eleven |
| 10:50 | Ten to eleven |
| 11:00 | Eleven O'clock |
