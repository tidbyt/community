# Now Showing for Tidbyt

Now Showing is an app that will display new movies showing in theaters.

It will display the title of the movie and a description of the plot, along with information on the actors and directors.

You have the option of displaying a photo from the movie as well.

Sometimes this could be hard to read, so you can control the text colors of the title and description.

If it is still difficult to read, you can add black "closed caption" style bars behind the text which obscures the image, 
however, it'll make it easier to read.
