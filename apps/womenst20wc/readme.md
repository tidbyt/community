A little bit different from the other T20 cricket apps I've made. This one gets its initial match info from the specific tournament/series API, not from *all* cricket matches. So it will show the next match for the team rather than say there are no matches scheduled if its not immediate

Also combined the display for FINISHED and POST statuses. POST doesn't give the viewer the match outcome, eg Team won by xx runs or wickets. It just says who wins without any details. Also the MVP, Best Bat and Best Bowl info aren't always listed so lets remove them
