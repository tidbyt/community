# Paraland

Paraland shows you an endless parallax of perfectly looping, hand-drawn landscapes.

## Configuration

Paraland does not require you to authenticate with any service.

Currently, there are a few options to choose from - but since these are hand-drawn pixel art landscapes, making them takes some time. Any contributions to the app are welcome.

Configuration for the app includes selecting from the landscape options and also a speed at which the parallax occurs. In the future these will be a little more modular, but working under the constraints these function quite nicely!
