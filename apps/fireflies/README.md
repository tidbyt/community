## Fireflies

---

##### <i>Introduction</i>

Fireflies, often referred to as "nature's tiny lanterns," captivate the imagination of people worldwide. Scientifically known as Lampyridae, these beetles are renowned for their fascinating ability to emit light. This unique feature is not just a magical spectacle but also plays a vital role in their life cycle.

The most notable fireflies belong to species that exhibit bioluminescence during twilight to attract mates or prey. Their light typically ranges from green, yellow, or orange-red to occasionally blue or violet. The specific patterns and frequencies of these flashes serve as a complex communication system between individuals.

Matching these natural colors perfectly to HTML colors can be challenging due to species variations and differences in perception caused by environmental factors. However, approximate matches include:

>Yellow: #FFFF00  
Green: #ADFF2F (generally a light, slightly yellowish green)  
Orange-Red: #FF4500 (seen in some species, especially at lower luminance or from a distance)  
Faint Blue: #0000FF (a rare emission among fireflies)  

The radiance of fireflies is a mesmerizing spectacle that dots the night landscape, creating an almost celestial experience on Earth. They appear as stars within our reach, flickering with an erratic yet rhythmic pulse, painting the night sky with strokes of light. Their shimmer offers a sense of tranquility coupled with an intriguing excitement.

##### <i>Application</i>

This modified and refactored version of my original fireflies app achieves smooth transitions between frames, ensuring no jumping or jittering when displaying the changing WebP files. This seamless transition is crucial for providing an uninterrupted and visually appealing animation.

The app animates fireflies that move and glow with options for color customization and an optional clock display. Fireflies move in elliptical patterns with brightness controlled by sinusoidal functions.

Users have control over the number of fireflies, glow duration, speed of movement, and color. Colors can be set to a fixed option or randomized, and the app can display a clock showing local time based on a specified location.

The code offers four distinct sets of firefly data, each defining the fireflies' movement, appearance, and behavior:

>Set 1: Provides a balanced, classic firefly display.  
Set 2: Features rapid movements for a more dynamic experience.  
Set 3: Creates a slow, relaxing animation with larger paths.  
Set 4: Offers the most varied and intricate visual patterns.  

All the selectable options allow the app to cater to a wide range of experiences, from calm and soothing to energetic and dynamic, making it adaptable to different preferences and environments.

The animation can serve as a nighttime display, replacing a traditional nightlight in your room.

##### <i>Tidbyt Display</i>
The screen has the option to dislay the fireflies with or without the current time (<b>5:37 PM</b>).

<i>Fireflies with no time showing</i>
<img src = "./fireflies-no clock.gif" width=900>

<i>Fireflies with the current time</i>
<img src = "./fireflies-clock.gif" width=900>

Fireflies are not displayed if they move into the area of the clock when it is displayed.
