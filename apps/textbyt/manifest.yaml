summary: Display text messages
desc: 'Display text messages on your Tidbyt. To get started, text ''new'' to 610-TEXTBYT (610-839-8298). The service will reply with a unique feed id. Enter this feed id into the Textbyt app. To send your first message, start your text with `<name>@<feed id>`. The service will associate the name and feed id with your number so future texts will go to the same Tidbyt. NOTE: The API and SMS service that powers Textbyt is not affiliated with Tidbyt, Inc. Use at your own risk.'
