# LightningNode Applet for Tidbyt

Displays the Bitcoin Lightning Network statistics in a specific time period. Or displays the statistics of your own Lightning node. You can configure to show only a specific statistic, or turn on the animation what will loop through all statistics. Make sure if you provide a node pubkey that it is a correct hex of 66 characters. If you leave the pubkey field empty, you will see the network wide statistics.
