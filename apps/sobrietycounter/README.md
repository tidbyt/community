# Sobriety Counter

Celebrate your sobriety by counting how many days since your sober date! You can choose to specify the substance or behavior your are abstaining from (or enter your own), or leave it blank.

#### With substance/behavior

## TODO / Possible enhancements

- [ ] Change the date/time picker to just a date picker, if one ever becomes available
- [ ] Make it look prettier (add fireworks, colored text, etc.)
- [ ] Show counter in something other than days (months, years)?
