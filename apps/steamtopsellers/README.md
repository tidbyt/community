# Steam Top Sellers (A Tidbyt App)

## Overview
A simple [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com/) appliction intended to render a random selection from Steam's Top Seller list, including the game name, price, discount (optional) and an image.

This data is exposed via the Steam API using the "featured categories" resource (ie. `https://store.steampowered.com/api/featuredcategories`).

The API payload includes game metadata as well as an image resource. These details are used to populate frames in the Tidbyt app.

## Usage
After installing [Pixlet](https://tidbyt.dev/docs/build/installing-pixlet), run the following commands to render/serve the image locally. 

```
# Serve locally (default port 8080)
pixlet serve steamtopsellers/steam_top_sellers.star

# Render webp artifact
pixlet serve steamtopsellers/steam_top_sellers.star
```
