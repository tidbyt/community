# San Francisco Bay Ferry Applet for Tidbyt

Displays next ferry departure times for [San Francisco Bay
Ferry](https://sanfranciscobayferry.com/) routes.

This app lets users select a route and direction and displays the next few
departure times. If there are no more departures today, it shows the times for
tomorrow (or the next day with service) instead.

This applet uses the [GTFS](https://gtfs.org/) data [published by San Francisco
Bay Ferry](https://sanfranciscobayferry.com/developers) for schedule
information. This data is only available as a ZIP file, so the current copy is
baked into the code.
