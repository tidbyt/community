# Plex Recently Added

Shows recently added on plex server. Strongly recommend to run `index.js` as a proxy to communicate securely to the plex server. **It can be used without the use of running the proxy server `index.js`**, but you will need to **disable `Secure Connections: Required`, and use `Preferred` instead** (found in the network tab in your plex server settings). This is recommended against as it is a **security risk.**
