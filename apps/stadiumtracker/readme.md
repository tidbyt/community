# Stadium Tracker for Tidbyt

Stadium Tracker

This application will let you track which NFL stadiums and MLB parks you have visited, and also display the ones you have yet to visit.

Use it to plan your summer visits and see if there is a park near your destination to pick up for your bucket list!

The outline of the USA appears in green. It will display based on coordinates in a random pattern (top to bottom, or left to right, or top left to top right, or reverse)

Pick the league you are interested in, then mark the locations of all the stadiums you've been to. The USA outline will appear, then all locations in the selected league appear in dull yellow in a different order (By location, by team name, by team location etc.)

The locations you have visited as indicated in the settings will then appear in bright yellow, then blink. They'll blink once more before the display repeats.
