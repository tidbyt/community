# TidalGraph for Tidbyt
 Shows the tide height throughout the day of the ocean based on the selected NOAA tide station.

 The app comes with a number of NOAA stations to choose from, or you can choose to enter your own station via station ID. Stations, and their IDs, can be found in the [NOAA station locator](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/map/index.html)
