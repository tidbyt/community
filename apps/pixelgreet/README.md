PixelGreet is a Tidbyt application designed for vacation rental hosts, enabling them to craft customized messages and images for their guests. Make your guests feel at home with a personal touch, creating memorable experiences. Elevate your hosting, nurture lasting connections, and boost guest satisfaction with this versatile tool.


After registering an account on PixelGreet.com, users can access the calendar feature, enabling them to schedule multiple bookings. For each booking, users can include a personalized message and image to be displayed to their guests upon arrival. These custom messages and images can be scheduled well in advance and will be displayed on the Tidbyt when the guest arrives.


# Prerequisites

To use this application, you need to obtain an API key from PixelGreet. Follow these steps to get your key:

1. Visit PixelGreet.com and create a new account if you don't already have one.
2. Complete the registration form by providing the required information, such as your name, email address, and password, then submit the form.
3. Upon successful registration, you will be prompted to verify your email address. Check your email inbox for a verification email from PixelGreet, and click the link within the email to confirm your address.
4. After verifying your email address and logging into your PixelGreet account, go to the "Devices" section. Click "Add Device", set the "Device Type" to "Tydbit", and provide a name for the device. This will generate a new device with an API Key displayed on its card.
5. Use this API key for making API calls to the PixelGreet service.

⚠️ Important: Keep your API key secure and avoid sharing it publicly, as it grants access to your account and its associated data. If you believe your API key has been compromised, delete the affected device on the PixelGreet website and create a new one.
