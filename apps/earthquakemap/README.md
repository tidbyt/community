# Earthquake Map Applet for Tidbyt

## Description
Displays global earthquake data for, up to, the last 30 days. Applet preferences allow the user to filter the display on a minimum earthquake magnitude and on different time scales. Additionally, the user can select the central meredian of the map to be on the Prime Merdian, International Date Line, or the user's home location.

Check out the [Tidybt][tidbyt-url] for an awesome information display for your home. If you are intereasted in developing for the Tidbyt, check out the [Tidbyt Developers Page][tidbyt-dev-url].

[Tidbyt][tidbyt-dev-url] has a process where a contributor forks the community development repository, creates a branch in the contributor's own fork, and then runs a pull request against their development branch. I am maintaining development in this repository and then copying code that is ready into a branch of the fork for the pull request.
