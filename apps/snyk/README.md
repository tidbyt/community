[Snyk](https://snyk.io) is an open source security platform for finding out vulnerabilities in source code of an application. This works effectively in containerised applications as well. Just like an antivirus scans your device and finds out the threats ,in the same way it scans your source code and provides vulnerabilities 

An API key is required to access the Snyk REST api for your account.  You will also need the Organization ID and the Project ID that you wish to track.  These are available in the Snyk console.  A Snyk Business account is required for access to the REST apis.

The app tracks the number of medium, high, and critical issues for a given project.
