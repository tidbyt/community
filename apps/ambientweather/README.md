# Ambient Weather

Ambient Weather displays details from your [weather station](https://ambientweather.com).

Displayed:

- Location
- Temperature
- Humidity

## Configuration

In order to set up Ambient Weather, you'll need to gather a few things from your [Ambient Weather account](https://ambientweather.net/account).

1. Your Application Key
1. Your API Key
1. Your Station's MAC address

You can create a new API key on your account page. If you haven't already created one, an Application Key will be generated automatically for you.

You can find the MAC address of your station on your [devices page](https://ambientweather.net/devices).

## Thanks

Thanks a lot to @rohansingh as a lot of this applet was based on the work he did on the [Tempest applet](../tempest/).
