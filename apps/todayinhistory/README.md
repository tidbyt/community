# Today in history

This applet looks at Wikipedia for events for the current date, and parses them
into Births, Deaths and Events. It picks one of those events and displays it.

You can filter to exclude categories (e.g. only showing Births). In that case
you may want to alter the title as well.

Future enhancement is to allow filtering on "era" so you could perhaps only
see events for the ancient age.
