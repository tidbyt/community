Tronbyt-Apps is a hard fork of the Tidbyt's Community repo. These apps have been developed by the [Tidbyt community][3] 🚀
This exists because the Tidbyt folks have stopped merging pull requests since their acquisition by Modal.

This repo is for publishing apps to all Tronbyt (formally Tidbyt) users. Interested in developing apps? Check out [Pixlet][2] and follow the [Hello, World!][4] tutorial. When your app is ready to publish, follow our guide below.

## Quick Start

You should really read our [contributions guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md), our guide on [Publishing Apps][6], and the section below before diving in. But if you just want to go for it, run the following to generate all the code you need:

```

```

Before submission, run the following to ensure your app is ready to publish:

```
pixlet check <your app>.star
```
